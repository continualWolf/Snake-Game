This is a simple Snake game implemented in TypeScript. It's a classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game keeps track of the player's score, and the objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

# My Aim/Goal
With this game i simply wanted a way to practice my recently learnt Type Script skills
In the future i would like to slowly add a chess game along side the snake game as a way of challenging myself
