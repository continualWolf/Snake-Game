A simple, classic Snake game built using **TypeScript**. Control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and rack up the highest score possible — but beware! Colliding with the walls or yourself will end the game.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project began as a way for me to practice and solidify my **TypeScript** skills in a fun and engaging way. I wanted something visual, interactive, and nostalgic — and Snake felt like the perfect fit.

In the future, I plan to expand this project by introducing a **Chess game** alongside Snake (as we all know this means ill never get round to it), as a new challenge and learning opportunity.
